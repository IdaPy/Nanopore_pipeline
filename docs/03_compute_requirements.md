Approximate run time: Variable depending on whether it is targeted sequencing or whole genome sequencing, as well as coverage and the individual analyses requested. For instance, a 90X human sample run (options: `--snp --sv --mod --str --cnv --phased_vcf --joint_phasing --phase_mod --sex male`) takes less than 8h with recommended resources.

ARM processor support: False
